# Calculator with TailwindCSS, JavaScript

## Accidentally created a new interface for a Calculator App

Check out the site here *(Ctrl+👆🏼) --*  [Calculator](https://vignesh7701.github.io/Calculator_Web/)

![Demo](https://i.ibb.co/RSVSzff/Demo.png)


    The interface is just having seperate fields for Normal Calculation and Scientific Calculation
